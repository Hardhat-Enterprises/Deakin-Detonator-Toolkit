# üß∞ Deakin Detonator Toolkit

This repo houses the new version of the Deakin Detonator Toolkit application built with Modern Web technologies, shipping as a native desktop application.

-   UI built with [Mantine](https://mantine.dev), [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
-   Shipped as desktop client via [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).
-   GUI exhibition will be available here: http://34.129.77.178:8080 (Deakin Intranet Only)

`src/` contains the source code for the UI.
`src-tauri` contains the source code and configuration for the Tauri application.

## What is the Deakin Detonator Toolkit?

In its simplest definition, the Deakin Detonator Toolkit is a penetration testing toolkit. The toolkit allows you to use a variety of tools, without needing the "know-how" of each command.

# üõ†Ô∏è Exploit Development

All exploit scripts are expected to live in `/usr/share/ddt/`, and they will be executed by the Tauri application. It is recommended that you use Python for exploit development.

For the exploit scripts, it is important to ensure they are executable entirely with command line arguments, eg. `python3 my_exploit.py <ip> <port>`. This will simplify the integration of the exploit into the Tauri application.

`install_exploits.sh` is a helper script that will install all the exploit scripts in the `/usr/share/ddt/` directory. If you add new exploits, be sure to run this command again.

```bash
./install_exploits.sh
```

The `.deb` that Tauri builds will automatically do this for us for actual toolkit installation.

# üñ•Ô∏è System requirements

-   4GB RAM
-   2 CPU cores
-   Recmmended Kali 2024.1 or later

# üîß Setup

To install the Deakin Detonator Toolkit on Kali, you can follow either the new or old methods. The new method is a one&#8209;step process that utilises a bash script. If that doesn't work, the old method will take you through the steps manually.

## Run the application (dependency install and run)

1. Run the following command, this will install dependent packages, patching and and start the application:

    ```
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hardhat-Enterprises/Deakin-Detonator-Toolkit/main/install-update-media/setup_ddt.sh -o install_ddt.sh && chmod +x setup_ddt.sh && ./setup_ddt.sh
    ```

## Old method

1. Use this method if you get errors with the new method. Update your Kali:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

2. Upgrade your Kali:

    ```bash
    sudo apt upgrade --fix-missing -y
    ```

3. Install missing dependencies:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
        build-essential \
        curl \
        wget \
        libssl-dev \
        libgtk-3-dev \
        libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
        librsvg2-dev \
        dsniff \
    	dnsmap \
    	goldeneye \
    	arjun \
    	parsero \
    	sherlock \
    	foremost \
        bed
    ```

4. Close your current terminal and open a new one.

5. Install Rust:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    ```

6. Install Volta or Node. Volta no longer supports Apple silicon chip series (M series). Therefore, we can use an alternative like Node instead:

    ### for Apple silicon series user

    ```bash
    sudo apt install nodejs npm
    ```

    ### for Windows machines with an Intel/AMD chipset

    ```bash
    curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
    ```

7. Close your current terminal and open a new one.

8. Install Node:

    ### for Apple silicon series user

    ```bash
    npm install node
    ```

    ### for Windows machines with an Intel/AMD chipset

    ```bash
    volta install node
    ```

9. Install Yarn:

    ### for Apple silicon series user

    ```bash
    npm install yarn
    ```

    ### for Windows machines with an Intel/AMD chipset

    ```bash
    volta install yarn
    ```

10. Clone the repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hardhat-Enterprises/Deakin-Detonator-Toolkit
    ```

11. Change current directory to the toolkit:

    ```bash
    cd Deakin-Detonator-Toolkit
    ```

12. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

13. Run the application (dev mode):

    ```bash
    yarn run tauri dev
    ```

# üì∑ Screenshot

Once you have successfully implemented either method one or two, the application should open and look like the following screenshot:

# üì∑ Release

1. Change the version number in scr-tauri/tauri.conf.json larger than current version

2. Merge the main branch into release branch, it will trigger the CD pipeline to update the repo release info

3. The update information will appear when user open the app
