## Title

Implementation of Fping tool into PT-GUI

## Proposal status

-   Approved

## Implementation status

-   Implemented

## Context

This tool allows users to send ICMP echo requests to determine if a target host is responding. This tool is simple however it allows you to specify any number of targets either in the cli or through a file containing a list of targets. This allows users to put all targets within one folder and ping them all in without having to input the same command each time for a different target. The tool also allows different probing and output options that will let the user filter out targets that do not meet specification.

## Decision

I am proposing that the Fping tool is integrated into the PT-GUI as a new component that includes a basic functionality that also has an option for more advanced filtering.

## Consequences

I believe that with the addition of this tool, pinging targets to see a response is useful to determining viable options for other attack methods. This can also be very useful with using PT-GUI as a teaching tool as pinging targets is one of the first things students will need to learn and also gives additional options for filtering that can help students learn cli arguments in the ouput.
