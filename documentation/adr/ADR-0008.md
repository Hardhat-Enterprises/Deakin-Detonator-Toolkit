## Title

Integrating Suricata for Real-Time Network Traffic Analysis and Intrusion Detection

## Proposal status

- Rejected

## Implementation status

- Not Yet Started (Backlog Task for Future Contributors)

## Context

PT-GUI, an innovative penetration testing toolkit, currently lacks tools for real-time network traffic analysis and intrusion detection. Existing tools such as TShark and Nmap provide detailed packet analysis and network scanning but do not meet the need for continuous, automated, and rule-based detection of threats. This gap leaves PT-GUI users reliant on external tools for intrusion detection and prevention, which undermines the toolkit’s goal of being a comprehensive solution for penetration testing.

Suricata, an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), and network security monitoring (NSM) tool, addresses this gap. Suricata offers deep packet inspection, rule-based analysis, and real-time alerting, making it a critical addition to PT-GUI. Its inclusion would enable users to monitor and analyze live traffic for malicious activities, gain insights into network behavior patterns, and build a foundational understanding of intrusion detection systems. This aligns with PT-GUI's mission to enhance cybersecurity education and provide tools that are both powerful and user-friendly.

## Decision

To address the absence of real-time traffic monitoring and intrusion detection capabilities, I propose integrating Suricata into PT-GUI. The integration will include a dedicated interface within PT-GUI that is consistent with the design and functionality of existing tools in the toolkit. This interface will allow users to configure Suricata scans, select network interfaces for monitoring, and manage detection rules with ease.

The interface will follow PT-GUI’s established design principles, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience for users. Suricata’s output will be presented in a user-friendly format, summarizing alerts and highlighting detected threats to enable quick interpretation. For advanced users, the integration will also include the ability to export detailed logs for external analysis, further enhancing its utility.

Comprehensive documentation and tutorials will be provided to guide users through the configuration and usage of Suricata, ensuring that both novice and experienced users can leverage its features effectively. This integration will significantly expand PT-GUI’s capabilities, adding essential intrusion detection functionality while maintaining the toolkit’s commitment to accessibility and ease of use.

## Conseques

Positive:

- Fulfills the need for real-time traffic monitoring and automated threat detection within PT-GUI.
- Enhances PT-GUI’s educational value by introducing a professional-grade IDS/IPS tool for users to gain hands-on experience.
- Provides an all-in-one solution, reducing reliance on external tools for intrusion detection.

Negative:

- Adds complexity to PT-GUI’s maintenance due to Suricata’s updates and dependency management.
- May introduce a slight learning curve for users unfamiliar with intrusion detection systems, though documentation and tutorials will mitigate this.
