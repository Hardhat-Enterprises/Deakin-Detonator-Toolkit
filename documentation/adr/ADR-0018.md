## Title

Addition of Netdiscover as a Network Reconnaissance Tool

## Proposal status

Approved

## Implementation status

Work in progress

## Context

The current toolkit lacks a passive network discovery utility that is optimized for identifying live hosts in a local subnet with minimal network noise. While existing tools like Nmap provide comprehensive scanning capabilities, they operate actively and may trigger intrusion detection systems or logs. For environments that require stealth or low-interference operations, a passive alternative is needed. The tool must be lightweight, effective, and suitable for subnets without DHCP or DNS services.

## Decision

Netdiscover will be added to the toolkit as a passive ARP-based host discovery tool. It is suitable for identifying active hosts on a local network by listening to ARP traffic or sending ARP requests when required. This integration will involve including Netdiscover in the tool interface, providing documentation on its usage, and outlining scenarios where it is applicable.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

-   Provides a passive scanning alternative for low-noise environments.
-   Suitable for networks lacking DHCP or DNS services.
-   Lightweight and efficient on low-resource systems.

### Negative Consequences

-   Only effective within Layer 2 segments (local subnets).
-   May yield incomplete results on networks with static ARP entries or MAC filtering.
-   Requires root privileges, which could limit usability in some deployment environments.
