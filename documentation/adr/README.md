## Architecture decision record (ADR) explained

### What?

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences.

### Why?

**Justification**: ADRs help align architectural decisions with project goals by explicitly stating the reasons for choosing one approach over another, based on needs.

**Traceability**: ADRs provide a clear record of why certain architectural decisions were made, making it easier to trace the evolution of the system's architecture over time.

**Transparency**: Documenting decisions ensures that all stakeholders are aware of the reasoning behind architectural choices, promoting transparency.

**Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the rationale behind the system's architecture, reducing the learning curve.
