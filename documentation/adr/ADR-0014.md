# Title

Removing Dirb from PT-GUI

## Proposal status

Approved

## Implementation status

Implemented

## Context

PT-GUI is a GUI-based penetration testing toolkit aimed at making offensive security tasks more accessible for beginners and efficient for advanced users. One of the main goals of the project is to keep the interface streamlined by removing outdated or redundant tools, while still offering powerful and modern capabilities through a user-friendly experience.

Dirb, a command-line tool for brute-forcing directories and files on web servers, was originally included in PT-GUI for web content discovery. While it was useful in the past, Dirb has not seen any major updates since 2013. It lacks many modern features such as advanced filtering, request customization, and speed optimizations — all of which are expected in today’s pentesting workflows.

PT-GUI already includes **GoBuster** and **FFuf**, two well-maintained, fast, and feature-rich tools that completely cover and exceed Dirb’s functionality. GoBuster is simple and efficient for directory or DNS brute-forcing, while FFuf supports advanced fuzzing use cases like parameter and header testing, response filtering, and more.

Keeping Dirb in the toolkit at this point only introduces redundancy, increases maintenance effort, and risks promoting outdated practices to learners. Since GoBuster and FFuf offer better options for every use case Dirb was intended for, it no longer adds value to PT-GUI.

## Decision

Dirb will be removed from PT-GUI. Its features are fully covered by GoBuster and FFuf, which are modern, actively developed, and widely used in the community. This change keeps the toolkit focused, relevant, and easier to maintain.

GoBuster will stay as the recommended tool for basic web directory brute-forcing, and FFuf will be available for more advanced HTTP fuzzing. The Dirb configuration screen and tutorial will be deprecated and removed from the interface. Where relevant, users will be redirected to either GoBuster or FFuf for the same tasks.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

-   Reduces tool duplication and simplifies the GUI.
-   Keeps PT-GUI modern, focused, and easier to maintain.
-   Directs users toward better, more capable tools.
-   Removes the burden of maintaining UI logic for a legacy tool.
-   Frees up space for new features that align with PT-GUI’s goals.

### Negative Consequences

-   Users familiar with Dirb may need to switch to GoBuster or FFuf.
-   Some specific Dirb options might not map directly, but FFuf provides more flexibility overall.
