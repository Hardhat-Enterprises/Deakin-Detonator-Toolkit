## Title

Integrating WafW00f for Web Application Firewall Detection in PT-GUI

## Proposal status

-   Proposed

## Implementation status

-   Work in progress

## Context

The PT-GUI toolkit currently lacks the capability to detect Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), which are critical components in the defense of modern web applications. Identifying the presence and type of a WAF provides valuable insights into the security posture of a target system, enabling testers to adapt their strategies effectively. Without this capability, users must rely on external tools, which disrupt the workflow and undermine the goal of PT-GUI as a comprehensive penetration testing solution.

WafW00f is a well-recognized tool in the cybersecurity community for its ability to identify a wide range of WAFs with precision and reliability. By integrating WafW00f, PT-GUI can offer users the ability to detect WAFs directly within the platform, ensuring seamless and efficient reconnaissance during penetration testing.

## Decision

I propose to integrate WafW00f as a standalone tool within PT-GUI. The integration will involve the following steps:

-   Adding a mechanism to execute WafW00f scans from the PT-GUI interface, allowing users to input target URLs and view results directly within the application.
-   Formatting the output of WafW00f in a user-friendly manner, highlighting key details such as the type of WAF detected and potential implications.
-   Providing comprehensive documentation and tutorials to guide users on effectively leveraging the new functionality, reducing the learning curve and ensuring adoption.

The integration will be designed to maintain the lightweight nature of PT-GUI while adding significant value to the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

-   Expands PT-GUIâ€™s feature set by introducing WAF detection capabilities, aligning with its goal of being a comprehensive toolkit.
-   Improves user efficiency by eliminating the need to rely on external tools for WAF detection.
-   Enhances strategic planning during penetration tests by providing insights into the security measures protecting the target.

**Negative:**

-   Introduces a minor increase in maintenance complexity due to the need to monitor updates and changes to WafW00f.
-   Requires users to familiarize themselves with WAF detection if they are not already experienced, though this will be mitigated through detailed tutorials and documentation.
