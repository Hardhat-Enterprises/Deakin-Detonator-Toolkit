# ADR-004: Integration of Cybersecurity News Feed

**Title:** Integration of Cybersecurity News Feed  
**Proposal Status:** Proposed  
**Implementation Status:** Work in Progress (W-I-P)

---

## Context

The **PT-GUI** is a cybersecurity toolkit designed to educate and assist users in understanding vulnerabilities, real-world threats, and hacking techniques in a controlled environment.

This ADR proposes the integration of a **cybersecurity news feed** into PT-GUI to enhance user engagement and awareness by displaying the latest threats, exploits, and news headlines.

The primary goals of this feature are to:

-   Keep users informed about current cyber threats and trends.
-   Encourage regular usage of the platform.
-   Provide real-world context to learning material.
-   Help users relate the simulated vulnerabilities in PT-GUI with real-world incidents.

---

## Decision

PT-GUI will integrate a cybersecurity news feed into its dashboard.

### Key Design Decisions

-   **Data Source:** The news feed will fetch content from trusted cybersecurity news APIs (e.g., _The Hacker News_, _BleepingComputer_, or public RSS feeds).
-   **Display Method:** News will be displayed on the PT-GUI dashboard/homepage using a card or list-style UI component.
-   **Update Frequency:** News content will refresh every 24 hours or on user demand via a refresh button.
-   **Tech Stack:** Integration will utilize REST API calls in the backend (Node.js) and display content on the frontend (React) using a dynamic component.
-   **Fallback Strategy:** In case of API failure, cached or placeholder content will be shown to the user.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

-   Enhances the relevance and educational value of PT-GUI.
-   Keeps users informed with real-time cybersecurity developments.
-   Encourages repeated use of the platform for current awareness.
-   Provides contextual linkage between theoretical tools and real-world threats.

### Negative Consequences

-   Introduces external dependency on third-party news APIs.
-   Requires regular monitoring and potential rate-limiting handling.
-   Needs fallback and caching mechanisms to handle network/API issues.
-   Increases maintenance overhead to ensure data source accuracy and reliability.
