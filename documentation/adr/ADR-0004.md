# ADR-004: Integration of Cybersecurity News Feed

## Context

The **Deakin Detonator Toolkit (DDT)** is a cybersecurity toolkit designed to educate and assist users in learning about vulnerabilities, real-world threats, and hacking techniques in a controlled environment.

To enhance user engagement and awareness, I identified a potential improvement: **adding a cybersecurity news feed** that displays the latest threats, exploits, and news headlines.

This feature is intended to:

-   Keep users informed about current cyber threats and trends.
-   Encourage regular usage of the platform.
-   Provide real-world context to learning material.
-   Help users relate the simulated vulnerabilities in DDT with real-world incidents.

## Decision

I decided to **integrate a cybersecurity news feed** into the DDT platform.

### Key design decisions

-   **Data Source:** The news feed will fetch content from a trusted cybersecurity news API (e.g., _The Hacker News_, _BleepingComputer_, or public RSS feeds).
-   **Display Method:** News will be shown on the DDT dashboard/homepage using a **card or list UI component**.
-   **Update Frequency:** News content will **refresh every 24 hours**, or on user demand via a **refresh button**.
-   **Tech Stack:** Integration will be done using **REST API calls in the backend (Node.js)**, and the **frontend (React)** will display the data using a dynamic component.
-   **Fallback:** In case of API failure, **cached or placeholder content** will be shown to the user.

## Consequences

### ‚úÖ Pros

-   Increases the relevance and engagement of the DDT toolkit.
-   Provides real-world value to users learning cybersecurity.
-   Encourages users to revisit the toolkit frequently.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons

-   Adds an external dependency (reliability of news APIs).
-   Requires error handling and possibly rate-limiting.
-   Needs periodic review to ensure sources remain accurate and relevant.

### üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation

-   Choose **reliable and reputable sources**.
-   Implement **caching and API fallback strategies**.
-   Monitor **API usage** to avoid overuse or throttling.
