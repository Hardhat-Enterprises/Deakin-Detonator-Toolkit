Integration of HTTrack Functionality into the Toolkit

## Context

HTTrack is an open-source website copier and offline browser utility that allows users to download an entire website to a local machine while preserving its structure, resources, and internal links. This makes it useful for reconnaissance, offline analysis, and training purposes in authorized penetration testing workflows.

Currently, PT-GUI does not provide any built-in feature for website cloning, requiring users to install and operate such tools externally via the command line. This can be a barrier for beginners and slows down testing workflows. By integrating HTTrack directly into PT-GUI, we can offer a straightforward, GUI-based process for ethical and authorized website mirroring.

The proposed feature will be built into PT-GUI as a “Website Cloner” module. It will allow users to enter a target URL, configure optional cloning parameters, and download the mirrored site directly through the application. The system will handle HTTrack dependency detection and installation prompts, and display live progress and logs during the cloning process. A responsible use disclaimer will be shown before any operation to promote ethical practices.

## Decision

The Website Cloner feature will integrate HTTrack as the backend engine for mirroring websites. Users will be able to:

-   Enter the target website URL.
-   Choose the output folder for storing the mirrored site.
-   Configure options such as download depth, file type filters, and inclusion/exclusion rules.
-   View live progress logs within PT-GUI during the cloning process.
-   Open the mirrored site locally after completion.

The feature will automatically check if HTTrack is installed. If not, PT-GUI will prompt to install it (Linux via package manager) or provide the download link (Windows). The feature will be disabled by default until the user accepts a “Responsible Use” disclaimer, warning against unauthorized site cloning.

## Consequences

### Positive

1. Adds a streamlined and user-friendly web mirroring function directly into PT-GUI.
2. Reduces friction for beginners by removing the need for external tool setup.
3. Supports authorized reconnaissance and offline analysis workflows.
4. Enhances PT-GUI’s value as an all-in-one penetration testing toolkit.

### Negative

1. Risk of misuse for unauthorized cloning if ethical guidelines are ignored.
2. Introduces a cross-platform dependency that must be tested and maintained.
3. Potentially high bandwidth or storage usage if cloning settings are misconfigured.
4. Adds additional UI, dependency, and error-handling complexity to the application.
