Integration of Anonsurf Functionality into the Toolkit

## Implementation Status

In Progress

## Context

Anonsurf is a powerful Linux utility, originally developed for Parrot OS and later made available on Kali Linux, that routes all network traffic through the Tor network, effectively anonymizing the entire operating system. It modifies DNS resolvers, IP routing tables, and flushes identifying data to protect user privacy during reconnaissance or other network-related tasks.

Currently, PT-GUI lacks a built-in solution for system-wide anonymity. Users who want to perform anonymous operations must install and manage tools like Tor or Anonsurf separately, which introduces friction and adds manual setup steps that may discourage beginners or non-technical users.

By integrating Anonsurf as a privacy feature within PT-GUI, users will gain the ability to enable/disable system-wide anonymity with a simple toggle, while being clearly informed about ethical and legal considerations. This is especially useful for educational use, safe reconnaissance in test environments, and protecting identity during legitimate research activities.

The proposed feature is not meant to facilitate malicious use but rather to educate and empower users to understand the role of anonymization in cybersecurity. A mandatory Responsible Use disclaimer will precede activation to remind users of legal and ethical constraints.

## Decision

An “Anonymity Mode” toggle will be integrated into PT-GUI, powered by Anonsurf. This will:

-   Allow users to start/stop Anonsurf with a single click.

-   Automatically detect if Anonsurf is installed; if not, prompt for installation via APT.

-   Run background checks to confirm that the Tor network is active before anonymization is enabled.

-   Display real-time status (ON/OFF, traffic routed, Tor status).

-   Require users to accept a Responsible Use Disclaimer before first use, explaining ethical boundaries and legal implications of anonymity misuse.

-   Automatically revert traffic to the default routing when turned off.

## Consequences

## Positive

-   Adds a highly-requested anonymity function to PT-GUI, increasing its utility and maturity.

-   Supports ethical hacking and reconnaissance in controlled environments.

-   Lowers the barrier to using privacy tools, especially for students or new testers.

-   Promotes awareness of anonymity tools and responsible cybersecurity practices.

-   Keeps toolkit competitive with other penetration testing platforms.

## Negative

-   Potential misuse of anonymity if users disregard ethical/legal usage warnings.

-   Adds complexity to system operations (e.g., sudo/root access, routing changes).

-   Dependency on Tor and Anonsurf packages, which may break due to upstream changes.

-   Could interfere with other network-dependent tools inside PT-GUI.

-   Might require OS-specific handling (only tested and supported on Kali/Parrot OS for now).
