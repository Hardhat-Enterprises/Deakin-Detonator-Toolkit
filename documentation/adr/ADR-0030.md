# ADR-0030: Remove CrackMapExec from the Toolkit

## Proposal Status

ACCEPTED

## Implementation Status

COMPLETED

## Context

CrackMapExec (CME) was originally included in the Deakin Detonator Toolkit to support post-exploitation and lateral movement tasks, particularly within Windows environments. However, it has not received regular updates, leading to compatibility issues with newer Python versions and dependencies. Additionally, the toolkit has evolved to include more reliable and well-maintained alternatives such as `Impacket`, `rpcclient`, and `BloodHound`.

The presence of CME in the toolkit also increased build complexity and maintenance overhead without offering unique functionality that couldn't be achieved with other integrated tools.

## Decision

We decided to permanently remove CrackMapExec from:

-   CLI tool registry
-   GUI interface
-   `tools.json` configuration
-   Documentation and help references

## Conequences

### Positive

-   Reduces dependency and package management issues during installation.
-   Improves VM image build stability and compatibility.
-   Promotes usage of actively maintained and secure alternatives.
-   Streamlines the toolset for students and users.

### Negative

-   Users previously dependent on CME may need to adapt to alternate tools for SMB/Active Directory enumeration.
-   Some previously documented CME-specific workflows may need updating.
