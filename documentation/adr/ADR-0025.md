## Title

Addition of Nuclei for Vulnerability Scanning

## Proposal status

-   ACCEPTED

## Implementation status

-   IMPLEMENTED

## Context

PTGUI currently lacks a fast, modular, and regularly updated vulnerability scanning engine. While tools like Nikto and Skipfish offer basic web vulnerability scanning, they are either outdated or limited in functionality.

Nuclei, developed by ProjectDiscovery, provides:

-   Template-based scanning for CVEs, misconfigurations, exposed panels, etc.
-   Regular community-contributed updates.
-   Fast and lightweight execution (single binary).
-   Easy integration into CI/CD and GUI interfaces.

## Decision

We will integrate **Nuclei** into PTGUI as the default vulnerability scanner for web services. The GUI will support:

-   Scan initiation via Nuclei with customizable templates (e.g., CVEs, exposed endpoints).
-   Displaying results in a structured and easy-to-read format (JSON, tabular output, etc.).

In the **future**, Nuclei may replace **Nikto** entirely, provided it covers the full scope of vulnerability scanning Nikto offered, while also adding the flexibility and extensibility Nuclei brings. We'll initially run both scanners in parallel and gather feedback from users to decide whether to deprecate Nikto.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

-   Nuclei is a modern, active tool with a large community and regular updates.
-   Offers broader and faster vulnerability scanning with more control and customization.
-   Supports community-contributed templates and integrates better with modern tech stacks.
-   Keeps PTGUI relevant and technically up-to-date.

**Negative:**

-   Requires effort to create a clean frontend integration.
-   May need controls to prevent overly aggressive scans on shared environments.
-   There will be an initial transition phase where both Nikto and Nuclei are present.

**Future Consideration:**

-   If Nuclei outperforms Nikto and provides a complete feature set, Nikto will be deprecated and can be removed from PTGUI.
