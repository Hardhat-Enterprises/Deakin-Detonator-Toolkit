## Title

BetterCap Component Implementation

## Status

- Proposed

## Context

Adds a new module known as BetterCap for cybersec analysis. It's similar to metasploit, for wireless and networking issues, including...
	Scanning and hacking for basic Bluetooth devices (smart locks, for example)
	Scanning all types of WiFi
		Performing deauthentication attacks
		Performing RSN PMKID based clientless attacks on vulnerable access points
		WiFi bruteforcing
		Fake beacons for rogue access points
	Mousejack attacks on 2.4GHZ wifi enabled wireless devices
	CAN-Bus (Car electronics) attacks
	Basic IPV4/IPV6 attacks	
		Probing
		Recon
		SYN scan
		Sniffing and Fuzzing
		Spoofing (ARP, DNS, DHCP6, NDP IPV6)
		Proxies, packet based, tcp based, http/s based
		Basic servers (http/s, mdns)
		Rogue mysql server
	MAC changer module
	GPS module
	
Describe the issue or situation that is motivating this decision. Explain the context in which the decision is being made.

## Decision

Adding BetterCap as a base software for Deakin-Detonator-Toolkit, and opening an array of modules to implement, such as Bluetooth Device Discovery, mousejack testing, and scanning for insecure networks.
These modules are listed in the context section (very simply), but can be expanded upon.

## Consequences

What are the consequences of this decision? Consider what will become easier or more difficult because of this change.
	Easier:
	Opens up an array of new pentesting features for networks, including hardware pentesting for accessories users may have at home to test with.
	A lot of features may be relevant for certain cybersec classes.
	Future features will become easier to implement.
	
	More difficult:
	The software will become larger in size, and a lot of modules may overlap with modules that already exist. 
	It has a fair few dependencies as well, potentially making compatibilty issues more frequent.
	It would require a bit of work to actually implement the modules in DDT, and because it's relatively new, there may be vulnerabilities that are not yet known.
