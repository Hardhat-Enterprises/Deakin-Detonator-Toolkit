## Title

Integrating Cohere API for Cost-Effective Tool Output Analysis

## Proposal status

- Approved

## Implementation status

- Implemented

## Context

PT-GUI currently integrates OpenAI’s API through the "AskGPT" feature, which allows users to analyze tool outputs directly within the interface. This feature provides users with detailed insights and recommendations, making it particularly useful for those new to cybersecurity or penetration testing. The current OpenAI integration requires users to provide their own API keys, aligning with PT-GUI’s decentralized approach to managing external integrations.

While effective, the OpenAI integration has notable limitations. OpenAI’s free tier is only available to new users. Given the widespread adoption of ChatGPT, most PT-GUI users have likely exhausted their free-tier benefits, requiring them to purchase tokens to continue using the service. Additionally, OpenAI’s stricter token limits make it less suitable for frequent usage or analyzing larger datasets. Furthermore, OpenAI’s advanced conversational capabilities are often underutilized for simpler tasks, such as summarization or keyword extraction, which could be handled by a more lightweight solution.

The Cohere API is proposed as a complementary integration to address these challenges. Cohere’s free tier is universally available, regardless of prior usage, and offers significantly higher token limits. It is lightweight and optimized for tasks like summarization, keyword extraction, and categorization, making it a cost-effective and efficient alternative for specific use cases. By integrating Cohere, PT-GUI can provide users with a more scalable and accessible solution while retaining OpenAI for complex and conversational tasks.

## Decision

The Cohere API will be integrated into PT-GUI alongside the existing OpenAI implementation. A new "AskCohere" button will be added to the user interface, giving users the option to process tool outputs with Cohere. Similar to the current "AskGPT" feature, this integration will initially require users to provide their own Cohere API keys, maintaining the decentralized model used for OpenAI.

Cohere will focus on handling tasks such as summarization, keyword extraction, and categorization, leveraging its lightweight architecture for faster and more cost-effective processing. These tasks align with Cohere’s strengths, making it an ideal solution for straightforward tool output analysis. OpenAI, through the "AskGPT" feature, will remain available for more complex and conversational tasks requiring detailed explanations or interactive responses.

To transition to a centralized model in the future, PT-GUI will use a shared API key for Cohere, managed centrally. Instead of requiring individual API keys, users will access the feature via the shared key. Simple limits will be implemented to prevent excessive usage by any one user, ensuring fair and equal access for all. This approach simplifies user experience while retaining the cost benefits of Cohere’s free tier.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences:

- Cohere’s free tier is universally available, eliminating the cost barrier for users who have exhausted OpenAI’s free tier.
- Provides a lightweight and efficient solution for specific tasks, reducing processing costs and improving performance.
- Enhances scalability for frequent or high-volume use cases without incurring additional expenses.
- Offers users flexibility by enabling them to choose between Cohere for straightforward tasks and OpenAI for complex, conversational tasks.
- Centralized API management in the future will simplify access and ensure equitable usage.

### Negative Consequences:

- Development and testing are required to integrate the Cohere API into PT-GUI.
- Users will need to manage their own Cohere API keys in the initial phase, similar to the current OpenAI setup.
- Maintenance complexity will increase with the addition of a second API integration.
- Implementing centralized API management with usage limits will require additional effort during future development.
