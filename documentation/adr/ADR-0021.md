## Title

Removal of Amap from the Deakin Detonator Toolkit

## Proposal status

-   Approved

## Implementation status

-   Work in progress

## Context

Amap is a legacy service and port identification tool last updated in the early 2000s. The tool was historically used to identify application-level protocols on open ports. However, modern tools like Nmap have since evolved to include reliable service detection using the -sV option, rendering Amap obsolete. Additionally, Amap is no longer actively maintained, introduces compatibility issues on modern systems, and adds redundant functionality to the toolkit.

## Decision

I propose the removal of Amap from the Deakin Detonator Toolkit. Its functionality is fully covered by Nmap, which is actively maintained, more accurate, and better integrated with current penetration testing workflows.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

-   Reduces redundancy in the toolkit and minimizes maintenance burden.
-   Aligns with best practices by consolidating scanning tools around more modern and supported utilities.

**Negative:**

-   Legacy users accustomed to Amap may need to adapt to using Nmap exclusively.
