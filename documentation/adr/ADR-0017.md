Title
Removing CrackMapExec from PT-GUI

Proposal Status
Approved

Implementation Status
Not Implemented

Context
PT-GUI is a GUI-based penetration testing toolkit aimed at making offensive security tasks more accessible for beginners and efficient for advanced users. One of the primary goals of the project is to keep the interface streamlined by removing outdated or redundant tools while still offering powerful and modern capabilities through a user-friendly experience.

CrackMapExec (CME) was originally included in PT-GUI for post-exploitation operations in Windows/Active Directory environments. It provided capabilities such as SMB enumeration, credential spraying, and remote code execution.

However, CrackMapExec is no longer well-maintained and has become increasingly difficult to support due to:

Complex and outdated dependencies

Incompatibility with modern systems (e.g., Kali Linux)

A steep learning curve that contradicts PT-GUI’s beginner-friendly goals

Unstable performance and elevated permissions requirement

These issues affect usability, security, and long-term maintainability of PT-GUI.

Decision
CrackMapExec will be removed from PT-GUI.

Its removal will include:

Deleting its configuration panel and references from the GUI

Deprecating and removing documentation/tutorials specific to CME

Redirecting users to more reliable and modern tools for each of its core functionalities

This decision aligns with PT-GUI’s mission to offer stable, modern, and accessible tooling for offensive security workflows.

Alternative Tools
The functionality offered by CrackMapExec can be replaced with a combination of tools that are actively maintained and more modular:

Nmap
For SMB/NetBIOS enumeration using NSE scripts.

Hydra
For credential spraying and brute-force attacks.

SMB-Ghost Scanner
For identifying SMBv3.1.1 vulnerabilities (similar to CME’s SMB scanning).

NBTScan
Lightweight tool for discovering NetBIOS hostnames and IPs on local networks.

Arping
For low-level network discovery and reachability testing.

Each of these tools offers a focused and reliable approach to network and SMB enumeration, credential testing, and post-exploitation discovery — without the instability and overhead of CME.

Consequences
Positive
Simplifies the interface and reduces tool redundancy

Directs users toward modern, maintained, and modular alternatives

Lowers the maintenance burden of outdated code and dependencies

Improves PT-GUI’s stability, compatibility, and ease of use

Encourages more focused, secure workflows

Negative
Users who are accustomed to CME may need to adopt new tools

Some advanced CME features (like remote code execution over SMB) may require manual setup with other tools

Minor learning curve for those transitioning from CME
