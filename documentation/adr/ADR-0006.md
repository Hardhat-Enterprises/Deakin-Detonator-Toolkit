## Title

Integration of the Tcdump tool into PT-GUI

## Proposal status

What is the status of this decision?

-   Approved

## Implementation status

-   Work in progress

## Context

Tcpdump is a widely used command line packet analysis tool. It provides similar features to an already integrated tool - Tshark.
Tcpdump is lightweight and provides features such as packet filtering and the ability to read and write to Pcap files.
While older, this tool is still highly relevent and content is still being frequently referenced in online guides.
The PT-GUI project is designed to teach students on command line tools. Being a command line tool, Tcpdump therefore fits
within the scope of this project. Another command line tool similar in scope and function has already been implemented,
however it is an adaption of an existing GUI tool. Tcpdump is dedicated and purpose built for packet analysis and therefore
its integration into the project is a logical choice.
