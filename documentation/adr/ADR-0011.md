## Title

OpenAPI Integration

## Proposal status

Proposed

## Implementation status

Work in progress

## Context

The Deakin Detonator Toolkit aims to simplify the learning of various Linux based penetration testing tools. Currently, the toolkit lacks an integrated feature to gain automated insights from outputs. ChatGPT, via its ability to integrate it into applications with OpenAPI, can provide automated analysis and guide users through their specific output results. However, this introduces an external API which has cost and possible performance implications, and will require individual developers to create individual API keys and pay for tokens until a centralised solution is available.

## Decision

The introduction of the following to the project:

1. A ChatGPTHelper module using node-fetch to handle API interactions.
2. Adding a feature in components to send tool outputs into a preset ChatGPT prompt and display the response.

## Consequences

-   **Positive:**
    -   Enhances educational value of the toolkit by providing detailed explanations of tools likely unfamiliar to the user.
    -   Improves user experience, particularly for beginners in cybersecurity.
-   **Negative:**
    -   Introduces a dependency on OpenAPI with associated costs.
    -   Requires secure management of individual API keys.
