Integration of Anonsurf-like Functionality into the Toolkit

## Implementation Status

## Context

Anonsurf is an anonymization tool for Kali Linux  that routes all system traffic through the Tor network to provide anonymity to the user. It manipulates system-wide DNS settings, configures IP routing through Tor, and has the option to disable insecure network services. This makes it useful to researchers who need to be anonymous while performing security testing, especially in sensitive environments.

While PT-GUI focuses on controlled penetration testing and ethical red-teaming, current functionality assumes an open and obvious network presence. For users who wish to remain anonymous while performing reconnaissance, scanning, or testing on authorized infrastructure, this represents a limitation in privacy.

The proposed feature is not a standalone tool but a built-in "Privacy Mode" toggle within the PT-GUI application. It will provide users with an option to route all network traffic generated by the toolkit through Tor, with safeguards and prompts to enable ethical usage.

## Decision

The Privacy Mode feature in PT-GUI will act as a built-in anonymization tool, taking its inspiration from the Anonsurf tool. It will allow users to easily activate a privacy-focused mode using a toggle switch within the toolkit settings menu. Upon activation, this mode will start up a Tor service (or comparable anonymizing structure) that reroutes all the outgoing network activity through the Tor network. It will also block all non-anonymous traffic from going through to prevent leaks and forward DNS requests through the anonymizing layer. When Privacy Mode is turned off, the system's native network and DNS settings will be restored securely. The feature will be turned off by default to minimize accidental usage. Users will be presented with an explicit disclaimer before they are allowed to turn it on, warning them about exercising their responsibility and morality. PT-GUI will also include a visual notification of when Privacy Mode is active to remind users of their current privacy status.

## Conequences

## Positive

    1.Makes PT-GUI more flexible and accommodates privacy-sustaining workflows.
    2.Reflects actual-world red-teaming routines, where anonymity is usually necessary.
    3.Accommodates researchers performing sensitive measurements on approved infrastructure.
    4.Enables users to gain a deeper understanding of traffic anonymization through practical experience.

## Negative

    1.Misuse possibility in unauthorized test environments if users disregard ethical advisories.
    2.Alteration of system-level DNS and routing may cause networking conflicts or disrupt connectivity in improperly configured systems
    3.Can cause load on external systems if users are not cautious with scanning or automated software.
    4.Adds complexity to toolkit's networking stack.

## Future Considerations

1.We can potentially add usage of Tor browser
2.Usage of VPN can be added
3.A kill-switch feature can be added to prevent data leaks if anonymizing fails
4.Make a toggle in UI to make anonymization status visible
