## Title

Replacement of Wifite with Wifite2 for Wireless Network Auditing

## Proposal status

-   Approved

## Implementation status

-   Work in progress

## Context

I’ve been using Wifite in the toolkit for wireless auditing, but it's clearly outdated now. It hasn’t been updated to the latest technology in a long time, doesn’t support recent wireless attack techniques, and struggles with newer drivers. This makes it less effective, especially when trying to demonstrate modern WPA/WPA2 vulnerabilities. Since I'm trying to keep all tools up to date and relevant, I decided it was time to look for a better alternative which is an updated version of Wifite that is Wifite2.

## Decision

I’m replacing Wifite with Wifite2. It's an updated version with active support, better compatibility, and features like automated handshake capture, PMKID attacks, and more. It’s also more beginner-friendly and works more smoothly with current network setups, which helps with both usability and performance.

## ConsequencesS

This change will make wireless auditing tasks a lot more efficient and reliable. I’ll have to update any references or docs that mentioned the old Wifite, but that’s a small trade-off. Overall, this move gives me a more powerful and up-to-date tool that actually works with modern systems.
