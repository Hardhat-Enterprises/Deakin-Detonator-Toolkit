Integrating Subjack for Subdomain Takeover Detection

## Proposal status

-   Proposed

## Implementation status

-   Work in progress

## Context

PT-GUI is a comprehensive penetration testing toolkit designed to streamline and simplify offensive security workflows. It currently integrates a variety of tools that assist with different aspects of penetration testing, from network scanning and service enumeration to web application testing and vulnerability assessments. Tools like Amass, Sublist3r, DNSRecon, and DNSEnum have been integrated into PT-GUI for DNS enumeration and subdomain discovery.

However, PT-GUI does not yet have an integrated solution for subdomain takeover detection, which is an increasingly important aspect of modern penetration testing. Subdomain takeovers occur when a subdomain points to a resource (such as a cloud storage bucket, GitHub page, or other third-party services) that is no longer under the owner’s control. This can leave the subdomain vulnerable to hijacking by attackers, who can then use the resource to execute malicious actions, steal data, or impersonate the organization.

Subjack is an open-source tool specifically designed to identify subdomains that are vulnerable to takeover. It works by querying DNS records for a given list of subdomains and checking if they point to resources that are no longer active or accessible. If a subdomain is found to be abandoned or misconfigured, Subjack will flag it as vulnerable to takeover.

Although PT-GUI already integrates tools for discovering subdomains, these tools do not specifically address the risk of subdomain takeovers. As subdomain hijacking is a prevalent security risk, it is crucial for PT-GUI to provide a solution that can detect and flag these vulnerabilities. Integrating Subjack into PT-GUI will add an extra layer of analysis for subdomain takeovers, allowing penetration testers to detect these vulnerabilities within PT-GUI’s interface if desired.

## Decision

I propose integrating Subjack into PT-GUI as a separate tool. Users can manually input subdomains discovered through other reconnaissance tools (such as Amass, Sublist3r, DNSRecon) into Subjack to scan for subdomain takeover vulnerabilities. The process will be initiated by the user once subdomains are found.

The output from Subjack will be incorporated into PT-GUI’s interface, where users can view which subdomains are vulnerable to takeover. The integration will also provide a way to export the results in a structured format, such as JSON, for further analysis or reporting. This decision will add value to PT-GUI by offering penetration testers a tool to assess subdomain takeover vulnerabilities, complementing PT-GUI's existing tools without automatically integrating this process into the workflow.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences:

-   Allowing users to manually assess whether discovered subdomains are vulnerable to takeover.
-   Improved reconnaissance by adding a dedicated subdomain takeover detection feature, complementing existing tools like Amass and Sublist3r.
-   Streamlined workflow as users can directly access and run Subjack from within PT-GUI, rather than relying on external tools.
-   Increased value for penetration testers working with cloud-native infrastructures that rely heavily on subdomains.

### Negative Consequences:

-   Increased maintenance as Subjack will need to be regularly updated and maintained to ensure compatibility with PT-GUI and evolving subdomain takeover detection techniques.
-   Complexity in output handling, particularly if many subdomains are flagged. This requires careful UI design to present the results clearly.
-   False positives are possible, as Subjack may flag subdomains that are not actually vulnerable. These would need to be manually verified by the penetration tester.
