Title
Integrating IP Tracing via Traceroute, Whois, and Geo IP in DDT

Implementation Status
Proposed

Context
The Deakin Detonator Toolkit (DDT) currently includes traceroute and whois as standalone tools for network analysis and reconnaissance. However, users must manually combine the outputs of these tools with additional Geo IP data to create a comprehensive IP tracing workflow. This process is time-consuming and error-prone.

To enhance DDTâ€™s usability and functionality, it is proposed to integrate these tools into a single, cohesive IP tracing feature. This feature will streamline the process, enabling users to trace an IP, identify ownership information, and determine its geographic location in a single operation.

Decision
The IP tracing functionality will:

Combine Tools: Integrate traceroute, whois, and Geo IP into a single workflow within DDT.
Traceroute: Maps the path packets take to the destination.
Whois: Retrieves ownership and registration details for IPs.
Geo IP: Locates geographic coordinates of the traced IPs.
Unified Output: Provide a single output that includes the hops (via traceroute), owner details (via whois), and geographic locations (via Geo IP).
User Experience: Offer both CLI and GUI options to trigger the IP tracing feature. The feature will output data in human-readable and JSON formats for further analysis.
Scalability: Implement the functionality in a modular manner to allow future enhancements, such as adding more data sources or extending the visualization capabilities.
Consequences
Positive Impacts:

Simplifies the process of tracing and analyzing IP addresses, saving users time and effort.
Enhances the usability and feature set of DDT, making it more attractive to cybersecurity professionals.
Provides richer and more actionable insights by combining data from multiple sources.
Potential Challenges:

Requires additional development effort to ensure seamless integration of the tools.
Increases the complexity of maintaining the codebase, as updates to any of the individual tools (traceroute, whois, Geo IP) must be reflected in the integrated workflow.
Could introduce performance overhead when combining the outputs, particularly for long traceroutes or high-latency networks.
