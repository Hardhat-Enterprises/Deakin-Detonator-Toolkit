Title
Integration of IP TraceRoute, WHOIS, and GeoIP into a Unified Tool for DDT

Proposal Status
Approved

Context
The Deakin Detonator Toolkit (DDT) is designed to provide comprehensive security assessment capabilities. Currently, DDT includes a variety of standalone tools, but the absence of a unified solution for network diagnostics and reconnaissance introduces inefficiencies.

A common need in penetration testing and cybersecurity analysis is the ability to trace the path of packets, obtain detailed information about IP addresses, and determine the geographical location of the target. Currently, achieving this requires the use of separate tools, increasing time and complexity.

By integrating IP TraceRoute, WHOIS, and GeoIP functionalities into a single tool, we can streamline the reconnaissance process, improving user efficiency and ensuring more effective workflows.

Decision
The proposal is to develop a unified tool within DDT that combines the functionalities of IP TraceRoute, WHOIS lookup, and GeoIP resolution. The features of the tool will include:

IP TraceRoute: Traces the route of packets to their destination, identifying all intermediate hops.
WHOIS Lookup: Provides detailed information about the ownership and registration details of IP addresses or domains.
GeoIP Resolution: Identifies the geographical location of each hop or the target IP.
The tool will be implemented with the following considerations:

A command-line interface (CLI) for easy integration into scripts and automation.
Modular design to allow future additions or enhancements.
Integration with existing DDT workflows and compatibility with the DDT containerized environment.

Consequences

Streamlined Workflow: Users can perform network diagnostics and gather reconnaissance data using a single tool, reducing complexity and execution time.
Improved Efficiency: The integration eliminates the need to switch between multiple tools or manually aggregate data.
Enhanced Capabilities: Offers deeper insights by combining data from multiple sources (e.g., route analysis with ownership and location data).
