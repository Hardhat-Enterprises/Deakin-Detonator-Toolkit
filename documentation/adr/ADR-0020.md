# Title

Integration of AI-Based Scenario Training Feature in PT-GUI

## Proposal Status

Approved

## Implementation Status

In Progress

## Context

PT-GUI has been developed with a strong emphasis on supporting both red-teaming practices and improving the learning experience for penetration testers. The toolkit provides users with static walkthroughs, CVE-based attack vectors, and the ability to execute individual tools for practical use.

However, the existing structure limits users to isolated tasks such as running a single tool or exploiting a CVE, without offering guidance on how to approach a complete penetration testing scenario. This reduces the toolkit's educational potential, especially for users seeking to understand how different stages of an attack fit together in a real-world context.

Scenario-based learning is a critical approach in cybersecurity education, as it helps users develop the mindset of an attacker. It requires them to understand the target infrastructure, select the appropriate attack vector, use available tools effectively, and follow a logical attack flow while considering mitigation and remediation strategies.

To address this gap, the AI Scenario Training feature has been proposed. This feature will leverage GPT-4 to dynamically generate realistic penetration testing scenarios within PT-GUI. The generated scenarios will adapt based on user-selected difficulty, attack vector (CVE or exploit), and optional tool selection from PT-GUI.

## Decision

The AI-based Scenario Training feature will be implemented to enhance PT-GUI’s focus on red-teaming methodologies while also improving its value as an educational toolkit.

This feature will allow users to generate detailed and guided penetration testing scenarios directly within PT-GUI by interacting with GPT-4. The scenario content will adapt dynamically based on the user's selected difficulty level, specific attack vector (including both CVEs and exploits), and available tools.

A key design decision is the enforcement of tool availability logic. Tools available within PT-GUI will be recommended for direct use. If a tool is not part of PT-GUI, the scenario will explicitly advise the user to use it externally via CLI. This will ensure consistency within the toolkit while maintaining flexibility for real-world learning.

Each generated scenario will be structured into well-defined sections that guide users through a full attack simulation. These sections will include scenario context, objective, attack vector details, recommended PT-GUI tools, step-by-step hints, expected outcome, and remediation suggestions tailored specifically to the selected CVE or exploit.

An additional feature will allow users to write their own report after completing the scenario and export it as a .txt file for documentation. This supports hands-on technical skill development with industry-relevant reporting practices and ethical considerations.

The AI Scenario Training feature will align with PT-GUI’s long-term vision of combining cybersecurity education with red-teaming methodology. It will provide learners with a structured, guided, and highly realistic environment to practice and develop their penetration testing skills.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

-   Strengthens PT-GUI’s educational capabilities by simulating real-world attacks through scenario generation.
-   Promotes the correct usage of tools already available in PT-GUI.
-   Provides flexibility by suggesting external CLI tools only when required.
-   Supports ethical learning by generating CVE/exploit-specific remediation advice.
-   Adds reporting functionality, helping users develop documentation skills.
-   Introduces a unique scenario-based training module, making PT-GUI stand out from other GUI-based penetration testing tools.

### Negative Consequences

-   Requires users to configure their own OpenAI API key to use the GPT-4 functionality.
-   Will require ongoing prompt refinement and testing as new tools and CVEs/exploits are added.
-   AI-generated responses might vary depending on OpenAI's model output and context length limitations.
-   Slight increase in maintenance overhead to keep the Scenario Training feature accurate, relevant, and aligned with new PT-GUI updates.
