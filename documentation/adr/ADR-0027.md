## Title

Addition of User Feedback Feature to Deakin Detonator Toolkit

## Proposal status

What is the status of this decision?

-   Proposed

## Implementation status

-   Implemented

## Context

The Deakin Detonator Toolkit lacked a way for users to share their feedback or experience while using the platform. Providing a direct channel for users to submit feedback improves user engagement and allows the development team to gather insights for future improvements.

Moreover, displaying community feedback helps build trust and gives new users confidence by showcasing existing positive experiences.

## Decision

A Feedback page was created with the following characteristics:

A "Feedback" button was added to the main navigation menu below "References".

A Feedback submission form was developed where users can write and submit their feedback.

Submitted feedback is stored in localStorage to persist between sessions.

Dummy feedback entries were pre-populated for demonstration purposes.

A community feedback section was designed to display all collected feedback in a clean, card-based layout.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

Improved user engagement and platform interaction.

Users can now see feedback from others, enhancing credibility.

Simple, scalable addition without major architectural overhead.

### Negative Consequences

Feedback can be submitted anonymously. There's no way to verify if the feedback is genuine or spam, which could lead to irrelevant or fake reviews.

Feedback is stored only locally in the user's browser, not shared across different users or devices.

Not suitable for production-level feedback tracking (no database, no moderation).

The feedback page displays all entries but lacks filters or search functionality to find specific feedback or sort by latest, most helpful, etc.
