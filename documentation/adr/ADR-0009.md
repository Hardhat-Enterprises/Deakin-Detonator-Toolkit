## Proposal status

What is the status of this decision?

-   Approved

## Implementation status

-   Completed

## Context

PT-GUI is a penetration testing toolkit designed to facilitate offensive security workflows, with a primary focus on red-team operations such as reconnaissance, exploitation, and attack simulation. Its primary objective is to equip users with streamlined, task-specific tools that align with penetration testing methodologies. TShark, a command-line network protocol analyzer, supports functionalities like live traffic capture, `.pcap` file analysis, and packet filtering. While these capabilities are robust, they are more relevant to defensive security operations, such as network monitoring and incident response, which do not align with PT-GUI's offensive security focus. Moreover, TShark is inherently a terminal-based tool designed for environments where GUI tools like Wireshark are not available. Attempting to integrate TShark into a GUI-focused toolkit such as PT-GUI is redundant and contrary to its original purpose. Wireshark already provides a superior GUI-based experience for `.pcap` analysis, making a GUI integration of TShark unnecessary.

PT-GUI already integrates tools that sufficiently cover offensive security use cases. For example, Airbase-NG enables wireless traffic capture and rogue access point creation for wireless attack scenarios. Urlsnarf aids in web-based reconnaissance by logging HTTP requests and URLs in real-time. Netcat facilitates raw network connections, port scanning, and packet crafting, while Hping3 supports custom packet crafting for protocol-specific testing and attack simulation. Nmap provides advanced host discovery, service enumeration, and reconnaissance capabilities. These tools collectively address many of TShark’s offensive use cases while remaining aligned with PT-GUI’s focus on offensive security. Removing TShark will simplify the toolkit by eliminating features unnecessary for offensive penetration testing, avoid redundancy with Wireshark, and improve usability for its users.

## Decision

TShark will be removed from PT-GUI as it does not align with the toolkit’s focus on offensive penetration testing workflows. TShark is primarily a defensive tool that supports `.pcap` analysis and network monitoring, which are outside the scope of PT-GUI’s offensive objectives. Many of its use cases, such as traffic capture and filtering, are already handled by existing tools within PT-GUI. Airbase-NG sufficiently supports `.pcap` capture for wireless traffic, while Urlsnarf, Netcat, and Hping3 address logging, packet crafting, and testing needs. Furthermore, removing TShark will reduce the complexity of the toolkit and free up resources for maintaining and enhancing tools that align more closely with PT-GUI’s offensive focus. Additionally, TShark’s design as a terminal-based tool makes its integration into a GUI environment like PT-GUI redundant. Wireshark, which is specifically built for GUI-based `.pcap` analysis, serves as a more appropriate alternative for such use cases. This decision ensures that PT-GUI remains streamlined and dedicated to tools essential for red-team methodologies. Users requiring advanced `.pcap` analysis or inspection can continue to rely on external tools like Wireshark as needed.

## Consequences

#### **Positive Consequences**

-   PT-GUI remains dedicated to offensive security, with tools specifically tailored to red team needs.
-   Overlapping functionalities are removed, ensuring a streamlined toolset.
-   The toolkit becomes easier to use, reducing the learning curve for users and enhancing focus on offensive tasks.
-   Resources can be redirected toward improving and maintaining tools that align more closely with PT-GUI’s mission.

#### **Negative Consequences**

-   Users requiring `.pcap` analysis or detailed protocol inspection will need to rely on external tools such as Wireshark.
-   Users familiar with TShark workflows may need to adapt to alternative tools within PT-GUI or integrate external solutions.
