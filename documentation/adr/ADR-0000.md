## Title

Adopting Rust for Backend Development

## Proposal Status

-   Approved

## Implementation status

-   Implemented

## Context

Our current backend is primarily written in Python, but we are encountering performance bottlenecks in processing large datasets and handling concurrent connections. Additionally, the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) has limited our ability to fully utilize multi-core processors. We need a solution that offers better performance, efficient concurrency, and safety without sacrificing developer productivity.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt Rust for developing new backend services, particularly those requiring high performance and concurrency. Rust's memory safety guarantees, lack of a runtime, and modern concurrency model make it an ideal choice for these use cases. Existing Python services will continue to be maintained, but new performance-critical components will be implemented in Rust. We will start by building a microservice for handling real-time data processing and evaluate the feasibility of migrating other components over time.

## Consequences

-   **Positive:**
    -   Improved performance and scalability of backend services.
    -   Enhanced safety and reliability due to Rust's strict compile-time checks.
    -   Reduced runtime errors and security vulnerabilities related to memory management.
-   **Negative:**
    -   Steeper learning curve for developers new to Rust, potentially slowing down initial development.
    -   Increased complexity in the tech stack with the introduction of a new programming language.
    -   Potential integration challenges between Rust and the existing Python codebase, requiring careful consideration of interoperability solutions.
