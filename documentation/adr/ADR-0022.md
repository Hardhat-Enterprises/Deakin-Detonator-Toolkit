## Title

Addition of Nuclei for Vulnerability Scanning

## Proposal status

-   Proposed

## Implementation status

-   Proposed

## Context

PTGUI currently lacks a fast, modular, and regularly updated vulnerability scanning engine. While tools like **Nikto** offer web vulnerability scanning, they are outdated and limited in functionality. Nikto focuses mainly on basic misconfigurations and web server banner checks, and while it serves a purpose, it's no longer actively maintained or as effective as newer tools.

**Nuclei**, developed by ProjectDiscovery, is:

-   A modern, fast, and modular scanner.
-   Actively maintained with regular community contributions.
-   Supports a broad range of vulnerability scanning through templates (CVEs, misconfigurations, exposed panels, etc.).
-   Lightweight and designed for easy integration into CI/CD pipelines and GUI tools.

## Decision

We will integrate **Nuclei** into PTGUI as the default vulnerability scanner for web services. The GUI will support:

-   Scan initiation via Nuclei with customizable templates (e.g., CVEs, exposed endpoints).
-   Displaying results in a structured and easy-to-read format (JSON, tabular output, etc.).

In the **future**, Nuclei may replace **Nikto** entirely, provided it covers the full scope of vulnerability scanning Nikto offered, while also adding the flexibility and extensibility Nuclei brings. We'll initially run both scanners in parallel and gather feedback from users to decide whether to deprecate Nikto.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

-   Nuclei is a modern, active tool with a large community and regular updates.
-   Offers broader and faster vulnerability scanning with more control and customization.
-   Supports community-contributed templates and integrates better with modern tech stacks.
-   Keeps PTGUI relevant and technically up-to-date.

**Negative:**

-   Requires effort to integrate and ensure a clean frontend experience.
-   There will be an initial transition phase where both Nikto and Nuclei are present.

**Future Consideration:**

-   If Nuclei outperforms Nikto and provides a complete feature set, Nikto will be deprecated and removed from PTGUI.
