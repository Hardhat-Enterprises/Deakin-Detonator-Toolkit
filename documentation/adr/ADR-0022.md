## Title

Add feature to temporarily block access to broken tools

## Proposal Status

-   REJECTED

## Implementation status

-   Work in progress

## Context

The PT-GUI toolkit includes a wide range of tools accessible via a user-friendly interface. Each tool is launched using a blue ‘Go’ button, which opens its dedicated user interface. However, when certain tools are broken, under development, or not functioning correctly, they remain visible and accessible to users. This can lead to frustration, confusion, and wasted time, especially for less experienced users who may not understand the tool's current state.
There is currently no built-in method for developers or testers to restrict access to non-functional tools or flag them as being in development. This lack of status indication reduces overall usability and creates a disconnect between the development lifecycle and the user interface.

## Decision

Introduce a feature that allows broken or in-development tools to be temporarily blocked from user access. This will be achieved by:

-   Changing the blue ‘Go’ button to display as ‘In Development’ and rendering it non-clickable/greyed out when the tool is marked as non-operational.
-   Allowing manual toggling of a tool’s status by developers or testers to enable or disable user access.
-   Providing an optional user-facing toggle to show/hide tools currently marked as in development.

## Consequences

-   **Positive:**

    -   Prevents user frustration caused by attempting to run broken or incomplete tools.
    -   Helps development and testing teams identify and prioritise tool repairs.
    -   Allows for better communication of tool status without needing external documentation.
    -   Supports scalability as more tools are added to the toolkit.

-   **Negative:**
    -   Requires implementation of new UI elements and underlying logic to manage tool statuses.
    -   Slightly increases maintenance overhead, especially if status must be manually updated without full automation.
    -   May initially confuse users unless clear visual cues and optional tooltips are included.
