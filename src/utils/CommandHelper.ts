     * Implementation note, known bug, and limitations:
     *
     * Purpose:
     * This function was introduced to facilitate developers in testing their code that requires elevated privileges. Prior to this,
     * it was not possible to test code segments that demanded 'sudo'. With the incorporation of 'pkexec', we can now invoke commands
     * with elevated privileges, thereby enabling more comprehensive testing.
     *
     * Current Bug:
     * One of the limitations of this current implementation is that it doesn't keep track of the Child PID once the command starts.
     * This essentially means that, as of now, there's no way to cancel or interrupt the command once it has been initiated.
     * We are aware of this limitation and there are plans to address this in the future. However, for the time being, the bug persists.
     *
     * Implementation Limitation:
     * When using this function, every command executed in the current component (e.g., functions like nmap or airbase-ng) will be run
     * with root privileges. This means users will be prompted for the password every single time, leading to a potential user-experience
     * inconvenience. Developers and users should be aware of this behavior and use the function judiciously.
     *
     * Scope Bug:
     * There is an observed behavior wherein if you don't use `pkexec`, the `scope` is essential for specific commands (e.g., `snmp-check`)
     * in order for the command to execute. However, when `pkexec` is employed, the scope seems to default to `pkexec`, making other scopes
     * (like `snmp-check`) redundant or not required. This is an important nuance to be aware of when relying on the `scope` behavior.
     *
     * Usage:
     * If you're looking to test commands requiring elevated privileges, simply replace the `runCommandGetPidAndOutput()` with this
     * `runCommandWithPkexec()` function. When the command is executed correctly, a GUI will pop up prompting for the password of your
     * machine. Ensure that you, or the user executing the command, know the password beforehand, as this is a security measure to gain
     * elevated privileges.
     *
     * Note: It's essential to be cautious when testing with elevated privileges, especially in production or critical environments.
